# SoundRecorder
Java, Firebase Database, Storage, Fragments

Android app which enables user to record audio tracks, listen to them and send to Firebase Storage (which might be held by audio processing company). User is entering his name as his "Id". I used Fragments: first to show tracks which user sent to Storage. Second fragment shows tracks which company uploaded (after they process it, for example: clean from noises) and user is able to download them.
